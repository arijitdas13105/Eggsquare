⏩/*// Review.js

🔴 {Array.from({ length: review.rating }, (_, index) => (
     <span key={index}>&#9733;</span> // Unicode character for star symbol
  ))}

                  
📌Array.from() is a static method available on the Array object. 
It creates a new array from an iterable object or array-like structure. 
In this case, we are creating an array of a specific length determined by review.rating.

📌The first argument of Array.from() is an object with a length property. 
The value of length is set to review.rating, 
which determines how many star elements should be created in the array.

📌The second argument of Array.from() is a map function that takes two parameters:
the current element (not used, so we use an underscore _ to denote it) and
the index of the element being processed. For each element in the newly created array,
this map function is called, and it returns a span element containing the star symbol (&#9733;).

📌The key prop is added to each span element with the value of index. 
The key prop is required when rendering a list of elements in React to help with efficient updates and rendering.

📌The Unicode character &#9733; represents the star symbol ★.
 This character will be displayed on the screen for each element in the array, 
 effectively rendering the number of stars equal to the review.rating value.

📌For example, if review.rating is 4, the code will generate four span elements,
 each displaying a star symbol, resulting in four stars being shown on the screen.

⏩//Cart.js

🔴 Calculate the total price of all cart items
const total = cartItems.reduce((accumulator, item) => {
  return accumulator + item.total;
}, 0);


🌟 cartItems is an array that contains all the items in the cart. Each item is an object with properties like title, quantity, packet, and total.

🌟 reduce is a powerful array method in JavaScript that helps us calculate a single value based on the elements of an array. In our case, we want to calculate the total price of all cart items.

🌟 The reduce method takes a function as its argument, which will be called for each element in the cartItems array.

🌟 The function inside reduce takes two parameters: accumulator and item. The accumulator is like a bucket where we store the intermediate result of the calculation, and item represents each cart item in the array.

🌟 The function returns the updated value of the accumulator plus the total value of the current item. It does this for each item in the cartItems array, accumulating the total price.

🌟 We start the reduction with an initial value of 0 for the accumulator. This means that the first time the function is called, accumulator is 0.

🌟 The reduce method then goes through each item in the cartItems array, adding the total value of each item to the accumulator.

🌟 After iterating through all the items in the cartItems array, the reduce method returns the final value of the accumulator, which is the total price of all cart items.

🌟 We store this final total price in the variable total, which we will use to display the total price of the cart items in the UI.
